README for MacroDiary

---

# Intention:

The purpose of this .py script is to start working on a program which will develop towards a project to learn programming.
To this end the idea is to start crafting an MVP that can be done in one to two days. 
At its final stage, I want this project to be implemented in python3, Java and C, with the use of SQL.

## Final Vision:
A gui program that let's the user store food (products, natural processed foods, fruits, vegetables, meats etc.) in an SQL db.
Then the user has the opportunity to use the program as both a calculator for macro nutrients ingested per meal/day/year whatever,
and also as a diary of what was consumed (logging, essentially but perhaps nicely presented and queryable).
From there I am pondering to add a recipe lookup, suggestion part to it.

# Overview:

This script should do the following:
Allow the user to input macros per 100g for a specific type of food (as mentioned above), the amount used for the meal, and the script aggregates
those and calculates the total amount of macros contained. Then this meal should be stored as such in a text file.
These meals shoulb be saved a blocks of data written out.

## Notes:
